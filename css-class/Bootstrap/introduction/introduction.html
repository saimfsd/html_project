            A paragraph is a distinct unit of writing, composed of one or more sentences, that focuses on a single idea or topic. It serves to organize and structure longer pieces of writing, making them easier to read and understand. Paragraphs typically begin with an indentation or a line break, signaling a shift in topic or a new point.
